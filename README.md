# Vezyl Translator

Basic translation software, providing the ability to translate to the specified language through popup when copying text

Note that this is a learning project for myself, and I'm a hobbyist programmer.


## Supported platforms
- Currently only support Windows.
- The software has been tested and runs stable tests on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
## Features
- Translate the text directly on the screen via a popup window (can turn on/off via a hot key or the door application icon on the menutray)
- Translation window accurate and fast
- Auto start with window (not working on alpha and beta version)
- Save translation history and favorites (only internal)
- Use Random encryption technology to secure data security
- 

## How to use it?
After installing, go to the application's settings, you will see the "Translation Language" and adjust it to your native language.

Now try copying a text (using Ctrl+C key combination or right -click -> Copy).A small icon will appear right next to the current location of Cursor.Click it and you can translate right on the screen.

To temporarily turn off this feature without completely turning off the application, use Shift+F2 key combination or click the application icon in the tray menu. And it should be changed to red when you have turned off this feature. 

To quickly turn on the application window, use Ctrl+Shift+F.(You can customize this also in the application settings)
